## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Bartosz and I'm currently a Computer Science student at the University of GdaÅ„sk. 
I also build web apps for commercial clients as a freelancer, currently open to collaborate on the next project. 

In 2023 I graduated with a BA in Music Production from the British and Irish Institute of Modern Music. In my hitherto music works I've been largely inspired by artists like Brian Eno, Holly Herndon, and the Beatles.
